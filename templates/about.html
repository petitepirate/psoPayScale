        <h2>About PSO PayScale</h2>
        <p>PSO in the sense that we use the term isn’t recognized as a job title on any of the standard salary estimator websites. For far too long PSOs have been asked to provide desired pay levels to secure project bids while having no insight into average pay rates as companies actively encourage contractors to not share their rates. This gap of knowledge has been exploited, driving contractor rates to the floor.  PSOs pay the price, but also contracting companies suffer as they underbid to win contracts to stay afloat and then resort to low rates and trimmed margins in order to staff projects - often leading to mismatched and inexperienced teams.  Excellent PSOs leave the field due to low wages and from feeling undervalued, and others lose motivation after coping with rates that have been cut up to 50%. There’s a whole host of other issues stemming from staffing projects this way and the hoarding of day rate data. It is my hope that this tool can help level the playing field for everyone.  I have high hopes for PSO PayScale, but I’ll be happy if it helps even just one person.  I’m so excited to give back to the community that was such an instrumental part of my life.</p>
